Super/60% layer
===============

This [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/ "AutoHotKey") script provides another layer of keys for a bit of extra comfort by having to move your hands less.

## The layout

Holding down the Win/Super key gives you access to the following layer. The rest of the Win+ key combinations work as usual.


         +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+
         | bksp | | del  | | ins  | | pgup |
         |  U   | |  I   | |  O   | |  P   |
         +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+
                   +------+          +------+
                   |  ↑   |          | pgdn |
                   |  K   |          |  ;   |
                   +------+          +------+
    +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+
    | home | |  ←   | |  ↓   | |  →   | | end  |
    |  N   | |  M   | |  ,   | |  .   | |  /   |
    +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+

## Limitations

It is not possible to remap the Win+L key combination under Windows.
